# benchmarks
A set of real-world ready-to-use benchmarks for QiLin.

1. `dacapo2006` comes from the artifact of [Mahjong](https://doi.org/10.1145/3140587.3062360) and should be used together with `JREs/jre1.6.0_45`
2. `dacapo2018` is the latest version of [DaCapo](https://github.com/dacapobench/dacapobench) (reversion:6cf0380) compiled by [LeeeWee](https://github.com/LeeeWee) (Many thanks!).
This set of benchmarks should work together with `JREs/jre1.8.0_312`.
